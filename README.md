## Real-World Applications

This simulation project demonstrates the potential for autonomous robots in warehouse operations, showcasing:

- Efficient inventory management
- Automated order fulfillment
- Enhanced workplace safety
- Optimized space utilization

## Prerequisites

- ROS 2 Foxy or later
- Gazebo 11 or later
- `ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs`

## Build the Warehouse Robot

1. Create `model.config` file
2. Download mesh files
3. Create `model.sdf` file
4. Test your robot in Gazebo

## Integrate ROS 2 and Gazebo

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs
